        <section>
            <h4>If Ye shall ask anything in my name, I will do [it]. John 14:14</h4>
            <p>Biblical verse talks about God as a caring father who acknowledges that He is more than capable to meet His children's need.
            </p>

    
        <h4>Do all things without murmurings and disputings. Phillippians 2:14
        </h4>
        <p>This elucidates that as Christians (children of God), we are not to give in to murmurings and, bitterness and excessive complaints, it only amount to hopelessness. And hopelessness does not regard the supremacy of God.
        </p>

       
        <h4>But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel. 1 Tim 5:8
        </h4>
        <p>This simply emphasises the core value of love, which is showing love to one's family. A true Christian will not neglect his home and responsibilities under the guise of ministry or special spiritual calling.
        </p>


        <h4>For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16
        </h4>

        <p>This explains that God did not give his son because he Hated him, but because he loves the people he has created as well. And because he wants everyone to inherit and be a partaker of his kingdom
